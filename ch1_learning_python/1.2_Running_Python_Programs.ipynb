    "\n",
    "Using an interactive prompt. You write a line of code, you hit enter, and the interpreter executes that line of code and shows the result (if any). \n",
    "\n",

    " \n",
    " - The interpreter is also known as a REPL (read-eval-print loop)\n",
    "\n",
    " - The REPL is great for learning, experimenting, and testing Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Demo**: Go into your terminal and type in `python`. This opens an interactive Python session for you, where your cursor will be placed on a line with some `>>>` to the left of it. Here, type `print(\"Hello World\")`.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Way 2: A .py file\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Demo**: Create a blank file called ``hello.py``, write ``print(\"Hello, world!\")`` inside it. Then, in your terminal, `cd` into the same directory where you put the file and run:\n",
