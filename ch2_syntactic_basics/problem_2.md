**1. You shouldn't...**
 - many things not to do. 
1. check out an individual file because this doesn't get all of the associated files or tied to a specifi version
2. Don't use -f (force) because this overrides the warning
3. Blow away the git directory

**2. I think...**
- I am a big fan of versioning up (committing) after signfiicant changes happen and branching when you make a new change. I think commit messages should include both what was changed and what has not been resolved yet. I think it's really easy to mess up your commits if you are not careful and the update practice should be one that is closely monitored
