    "\n",
    "Second of all, since I haven’t written this language before, I don’t know yet which syntax I’ll be using most often, so I’d be at a high risk of spending a disproportionate amount of time learning structures that I’m not going to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, I use generics a lot in Java, in part because I find myself using Java in large/complex systems or extremely generalized libraries. I don’t find myself using generics much in Swift because I typically use Swift for iOS client apps where each piece of code has a very specific use case. So, when I teach Swift, I don’t go over generics. I’d have to contrive an artificial situation to make them relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third of all, syntax is one of those things that I can look up on-demand with a search engine. When I need a case statement, I can Google “[LANGUAGE] case statement” and in most cases, the first result will tell me what I need to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth of all, syntax is a hard thing to accidentally mess up without realizing it. If the syntax is wrong, the program won’t run. Compare that to if I make an inaccurate assumption about precedence in the language. I think I’m assigning the result of an operation to a variable, but I’m really only assigning part of that operation, then finishing the operation on the assigned variable and throwing away the result. Now, when I reference the variable later, it’s null. I can’t figure out why because I am looking at the line where I am under the impression that I assigned the variable. Syntax doesn’t hang me up on insidious problems like this.\n",
