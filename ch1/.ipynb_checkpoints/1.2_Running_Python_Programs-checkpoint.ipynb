    "#### Running this program\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, there are two ways of running code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using an interactive prompt via the Python *interpreter* (i.e., a program that executes other programs. Using the interpreter in its interactive mode, will execute the instructions (i.e., the statements in your code) one by one. You write a line of code, you hit enter, and the interpreter executes that line of code and shows the result (if any). \n",
    "\n",
    " - The interpreter is accessible via the terminal program on your machine.\n",
    " \n",
    " - The interpreter is also known as a REPL (read, eval, print,\n",
    "loop)\n",
    "\n",
    " - The REPL is great for learning, experimenting, and testing Python code\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Demo**: Using the IPython interpreter to print ``Hello World`` \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Saving your code in a file and then *running* that file using the interpreter.\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    " - **Demo**: Create a blank file called ``hello.py``, write ``print(\"Hello, world!\")`` inside it, and then run::\n",
    "   \n",
    "       ipython hello.py\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: We will discuss how the interpter works in the coming weeks. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Python Programs \n",
    "\n",
    "As stated before, the REPL a good tool for experimenting with code interactively. Once your code becomes complex then you will want to save it as a Python program. These programs are saved in a ``.py`` file (or a collection of ``.py`` files). \n",
    " \n",
    "#### Aside: Python Versions \n",
    "\n",
    "Python2 and Python3 are the two main versions of Python. However, the end of life for Python2 happend at the beginning of 2020; therefore, Python3 is the future of the language and is the one we will use. "
