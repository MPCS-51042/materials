    " \n",
    " 1. The ``def`` defines a new function called ``name``.\n",
    " 2. Define zero or more parameters separated by commas in parentheses\n",
    " 3. A colon to indicate the beginning of the function body.\n",
    " 4. Functions ca define a **docstring** that provides a description of the function.\n",
    " 4. Statements inside function are indented and don’t run until the function is called\n",
    " 5. ``return`` can appear anywhere in body of function\n",
    "    - Can also be omitted. A function that does not return a value will return ``None`` by default. \n",
